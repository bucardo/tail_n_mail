* Query flattening improvements


Version 3.0.0, released July 25, 2020

* Major version bump!

* Minimum Perl version is now 5.8.0

  we start using "state" files to track information that changes 
  each run. With this change, config files to be easily tracked in git.
  [Greg Sabino Mullane]

* Show a breakdown of how many matches came from each file on multi-file matches

  [Greg Sabino Mullane]


Version 2.7.1, released March 11, 2020
